  questDescription: "There is a secret entrance hidden in the lower layer that leads
    out of the city. However it needs\r a particular key to unlock. Luckily I know
    that the Mining Foreman has one such\r key in his office, right for the taking,
    and when he is not out mining he wastes\r away all his time and money getting
    drunk at the tavern.\r He keeps it in a locker right outside his house. Go \"borrow\"
    that key and then find the secret entrance. If you make it I''ll find you on
    the other side.\r\n\rRemember, don''t let the guards see you!\r\n\nRegards,\r\nJohn"
